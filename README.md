# Distributed-E-commerce-Backend-System

Title: Distributed E-commerce Backend System

Description: A headless backend system for an e-commerce platform, built using a microservices architecture with Spring Boot. This project provides a complete set of RESTful APIs for managing users, products, and orders, focusing on scalability, resilience, and observability in a distributed environment.

B. Add an "API Endpoints" Section (Crucial!)

This is the most effective way to scream "backend." Document your key API endpoints.

API Endpoints
The following are examples of core API endpoints provided by the system.

Order Service
POST /api/orders - Creates a new order.

Body: { "userId": 1, "productId": 101, "quantity": 2 }

Description: This endpoint communicates with the User and Product services via Feign to validate the order before persisting it.

User Service
GET /api/users/{id} - Retrieves user details by ID.

Product Service
GET /api/products - Retrieves a list of all available products.
